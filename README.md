# Auric Network Smart Contracts

The main token contract is UFragments cloned from Based Money (who cloned
from Ampleforth). The contract will be deployed by the main address that 
will become the deployer and will have the right to intialize the contract.
When initializing the contract, the deployer specifies the owner who receives
the entire initial supply of tokens, which is set to be 30,000,000.

The owner then can set monetary policy. The monetary policy is allowed
to initiate rebases.
